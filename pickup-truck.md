# PICKUP TRUCK

They come in all sizes
Shapes, colors and styles
They’re rugged, they’re tough
They can rack up the miles
These are hard-working trucks
Never down on their luck

Their tires are big, small
Or somewhere between
Got so many skills can
Do most anything
Just name something they can’t do
Oh go on, I dare you!

Grandpa calls his a
Pick ’em up truck
Takes it off road don’t
Ever get stuck
Says it’s the ride he
Can always trust
Try to keep up you’ll
Be eatin’ his dust
He’s a pickup, a pickup truck
And for some working trucks
A bed’s just not enough
So some sport a rack to
Hold ladders and stuff
And when his rack’s loaded down
No trouble getting around

To be fully equipped add
A toolbox to the mix
And make sure that there’s
Not a thing you can’t fix
Load up all your gear inside
Go on, give it a try

Grandpa calls his a
Pick ’em up truck
Takes it off road don’t
Ever get stuck
Says it’s the ride he
Can always trust
Try to keep up you’ll
Be eatin’ his dust
He’s a pickup, a pickup truck
A pickup, a pickup truck
Don’t get me wrong
It’s not all about work
These trucks have fun too
They’re perfect for camping
Or a trip to the dunes
Can tow a boat trailer
Or pull an RV
For extra towing power
You might want a dually
Cuz that’s a pickup with 4 wheels in back
Yippee, yippee!
