# MONSTER TRUCK

There’s a truck that’s
Fast and loud
He’s happiest when
He plays for a crowd
Doing wheelies and donuts
And jump after jump
He loves to do
All kinds of stunts

He’s a brute
Some say a thug
Smashes little cars
Like they’re little bugs
He might crash or flip
His tires might pop
Doesn’t care much
He just won’t stop

So what would you call him?
When he’s the toughest
When he’s the baddest Truck around

Call him a Monster, Monster Truck
Let them hear how you roar
Monster, Monster Truck
Meanest 4×4

He can jump
A giant plane
Yes, this truck is
Completely insane
In arenas and stadiums
What do they shout?
As they watch him
Drive about

What do they call him?
When he’s the toughest
When he’s the baddest Truck around

They call him Monster, Monster Truck
Let them hear how you roar
Monster, Monster Truck
Meanest 4×4

And that’s what they call him
Cuz he’s the toughest
Cuz he’s the baddest Truck around
What they call him?

They call him Monster, Monster Truck
Let them hear how you roar
Monster, Monster Truck
Meanest 4×4
Monster, Monster Truck
Let them hear how you roar
Monster, Monster Truck
Meanest 4×4
