# TRACTOR TRAILER

Well, he’s got so many, many names
With all that he gets done
There ain’t no way he’d ever be
Happy with just one

You might hear Tractor Trailer
And that’s certainly true
Then there’s Big Rig, Semi Truck
And 18 wheeler too

So, Tractor Trailer
He’s got a Tractor in front
That’s where the driver sits
Pulls the Trailer in back
Cuz that’s where his cargo fits
And that’s why they call him a
Tractor Trailer

Now, Big Rig
The Tractor part is made to pull
And some call that a Rig
You need a ladder to get in
Because this truck is so darn big
And that’s why they call him a
Big Rig

Well, he’s got so many, many names
With all that he gets done
There ain’t no way he’d ever be
Happy with just one

You know he’s a Tractor Trailer
Well that’s certainly true
But this Big Rig is a Semi Truck
And an 18 wheeler too

So Semi Truck
The Trailer has no wheels in front
Cuz that’s where he hooks up
Semi means a half a thing
Oh he pulls with him
Half a truck
He’s pulling two trailers
That’s a double

Now 18 wheeler
Well that’s how many wheels he’s got
With nine wheels on each side
Some trucks have
And some have more
And some are extra wide
And this truck has twenty-five
Wait!
That’s twenty-four
My mistake

Well, he’s got so many, many names
With all that he gets done
There ain’t no way he’d ever be
As happy with just one
No he wouldn’t be happy
With just one
