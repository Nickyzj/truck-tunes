# BULLDOZER

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground

Like an enormous crazy, caterpillar
He is the meanest, toughest of all tractors
Known as a crawler, he’s so good at his work
Uses his ripper to break the hardest earth

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground

To do his moving, he uses a blade
It’s made of hard metal, some call it a plate
In back the ripper, can have one or more shanks
These trucks are so tough, they could tow a tank

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground

Their tracks of steel can work any terrain
They are so strong that, it boggles the brain
Working with scrapers and with graders too
They clear the land, and oh do it so soon

(SPOKEN) Seriously, this is one very tough truck. It uses its blade in front to scrape, push and move materials around. And it uses its ripper in back to tear up hard ground. The ripper can have just one shank, like on this dozer, or it can two or more shanks. The shanks are the teeth that the ripper uses to break up the ground. This truck has a ripper with two shanks. Listen, can you hear it scraping against the rocks as it tears up the earth!

Bulldozers use big metal tracks to move around. This gives them plenty of traction, allowing them to work just about anywhere. You might see bulldozers like this one working in a landfill or a dump, pushing piles of trash around.

And here’s another interesting thing about bulldozers: some of these trucks have decelerators instead of accelerators. This means that these trucks will just keep moving unless the driver steps on the decelerator to slow them down. Go, dozer, Go!

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground

They can push, or pull other big rigs
And help them out so they can dig and dig
The most stubborn dirt and stone that’s known
Or if they need to, they can work all alone

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground

They call him Bulldozer
Or just Dozer for short
And every morning
For work he’ll report

To shove big loads of
Dirt and rocks all around
And drag his ripper
To tear up the ground
