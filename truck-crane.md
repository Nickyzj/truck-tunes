# TRUCK CRANE

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high

He shows up at the job site
Find a spot that’s just right
And way before noon, oh
He’s working his telescoping boom
Outriggers are out
They keep him locked down
And hold him steady, oh
And now he’s ready, oh
Tell me who’s ready

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high

His cable’s in position
Lifting with precision
The Hook Block is now secure
He’s good at this, that’s for sure
The Winch will wind up
Carefully he lines up
The Boom extends and extends
And sets the load on end
Who sets the load on end

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high

Strong like you can’t believe
Tons of load capacity
Whatever the job needs
Look how he lifts this tree
When the job is complete
A full day in the heat
He loads up everything
And heads home to his fleet

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high

He’s a Truck Crane
Lifting up his cargo
Truck Crane
Reach into the sky
Truck Crane
No one else can go so high, high, high, high
