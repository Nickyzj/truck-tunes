# LOGGING TRUCK

A Logging Truck does
Just one thing
He’s a special Tractor Trailer
with a specialty
Now what exactly
does all that mean?
He concentrates on
Hauling trees

That’s right, this truck he’s
Made just for carrying trees
One tough, rugged Big Rig
Pulls logs like they were little twigs

And he waits for his trailer
To be loaded down with trees
While the loader with his grapple
Loads up everything he sees

Cuz, a Logging Truck does
Just one thing
He’s a special Tractor Trailer
with a specialty
Now what exactly
does all that mean?
He concentrates on
Hauling trees

Then he takes the load
Heads down the narrow road
Toward the staging zone
Sets the trailers all in a row

When along comes another semi ready to go
And he leaves behind a trailer
That’s been emptied of its load
Then he gets in line and backs right up
And he takes the trailer full of trees
And hooks it up

Cuz, a Logging Truck does
Just one thing
He’s a special Tractor Trailer
with a specialty
Now what exactly
does all that mean?
He concentrates on
Hauling trees

Secure he makes the logs
Makes sure they don’t fall off
Ratchets the straps down tight
He’s gotta do this job right

Off he goes with the logs
Now he’s headed on his way
Not the first or the last
Of the trips he’ll make today
He won’t rest, he won’t stop
He won’t call it quits until
He arrives back home
At the sawmill

Cuz, a Logging Truck does
Just one thing
He’s a special Tractor Trailer
with a specialty
Now what exactly
does all that mean?
He concentrates on
Hauling trees

Cuz, a Logging Truck does
Just one thing
He’s a special Tractor Trailer
with a specialty
Now what exactly
does all that mean?
He concentrates on
Hauling trees
