# SCRAPER

There’s a truck who works real hard, building roads for people’s cars
So you’ll have a place to drive around on
He sure loves to dig, dig, dig
Building homes where you can live
He’s the truck you know you can count on

If you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him cruising really fast to scrape up other ground
Cuz you can count on Scraper

He’s building a new community
These roads will soon be running streams
The water from the streams will make a lake here
Then homes will sprout up from the ground
Homes wherever you look around
Many kids like you will call it home here

Oh, if you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him as he digs and watch him as he shapes the ground
Yeah you can count on Scraper

Now here’s something you might not know
Where dirt is held is called the bowl
And where it opens up is called the apron
It opens up to take a load
And fills with dirt that leaves a hole
The ejector shoves it out so he can start again

So, if you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him cruising really fast to scrape up other ground
Cuz you can count on Scraper

(SPOKEN) A scraper’s job is to do “rough grading”. The straight, flat edge on the front of the scraper’s apron allows it to make even surfaces. So, while a scraper digs up dirt and moves it around, it helps to make the ground that it scrapes flat or even. This is why scrapers often work on roads and housing developments, where the ground needs to be flat. But, because a scraper does “rough grading”, the ground will need to smoothed out even more by other trucks, like the Grader we will see in a minute.

Some scrapers are also equipped with augers. The auger is made up of paddles that lift the dirt and rock off of the apron’s front edge. These paddles spread the dirt and rock evenly in the bowl. The auger reduces dust and helps to break up the ground as it is scraped up.

So if you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him cruising really fast to scrape up other ground
Cuz you can count on Scraper

After a short break for lunch
They rumble out and I’ve a hunch
They’ll be working all day long till night fall
If you see him while you’re out
Maybe you could call and shout
“Hey, there goes a Scraper!
I can count on him.”

Cuz if you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him cruising really fast to scrape up other ground
Cuz you can count on Scraper

Oh, if you’ve got a lot of dirt you need to move around
You can count on Scraper
Watch him as he digs and watch him as he shapes the ground
Yeah you can count on Scraper
