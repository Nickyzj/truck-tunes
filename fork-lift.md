# FORK LIFT

Let’s do the Forklift Boogie
Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
The Forklift Boogie, yeah!

Oh, let’s all do the Forklift Boogie
Back and forth and up and down
For a job like pallet moving
A better truck can not be found

See how high he lifts this crate up
Then so gently pulls his blades
He doesn’t want anything to break up
That’s just how a Forklift’s made

Let’s do the Forklift Boogie
Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
The Forklift Boogie, yeah!

A pallet’s made so his forks can fit through
Without any difficulty
Watch as this truck driver gets to
Line them up almost perfectly

Forklifts work in warehouses
At construction sites and lumber yards
There you’ll see large stacks of pallets
You won’t have to look too hard

To do the Forklift Boogie
Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
The Forklift Boogie, yeah!

(SPOKEN) Forklifts are made for lifting really heavy loads. The loads sit on the forks, which can also be called the blades. These blades are attached to a part called the carriage. And forklifts can lift their loads really high thanks to this part, called the mast. It lifts the carriage, and the forks, way up high. It can go slow. It can go fast. Whatever it takes to do it right. The driver usually tilts the load back when he’s lifting and carrying it so that it doesn’t slip off. He doesn’t want anything to come tumbling down while he’s lifting it to the top of this big storage rack. You won’t see any other truck quite like a forklift.

So do the Forklift Boogie
Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
The Forklift Boogie, yeah!

He can lift such heavy loads that
He has to have a counter weight in back
This is so he won’t tip over
Sometimes it’s a battery pack

And in case things come tumbling down
The forklift has an overhead guard
It protects the driver as he delivers his load
In the lumber yard

So do the Forklift Boogie
Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
Again! Lift it up, set it down
Back it up, turn around
The Forklift Boogie, yeah!

The Forklift Boogie everyone!
Come back and do it with me again sometime real soon now
