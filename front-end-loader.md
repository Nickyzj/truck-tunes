# FRONT END LOADER

Loaders often work with Dump Trucks
Helping them to fill their beds up
With rocks and gravel and other stuff

Others might be better at digging holes
But no one loads a load like a loader loads
And they can play many other roles

Because there isn’t any on the road as good at loading heavy loads
Front End Loader, you’re as good as gold

This truck is cleaning up the messy debris
Of bark and wood from all the fallen trees
Pushing and scooping it up with ease

Watch now as this real big loader feeds
A bucket full of little rocks that will be
Crushed to sand in this machine

Oh no, there isn’t any on the road as good at scooping up a load
Front End Loader, you’re as good as gold

Here’s another trick this loader can do
He can work just like a forklift, too
With this tool he can remove

And then with a very simple move
He can re-attach his bucket to
His arms we call the boom

Working far away in a wooded grove
A loader uses grapple hooks to hold
These logs that finish up the load

Oh no, there isn’t any on the road as good at finding ways to load
Front End Loader, you’re as good as gold

(SPOKEN) Let’s watch that trick again where the Front End Loader can go from working as a fork lift to hooking up its bucket. Both the forks and the bucket are attachments that can be connected to the Loader’s arms. This means that a Loader can transform into different kinds of machines if it needs to. For example, with a grapple attachment, this Loader picks up logs and loads up a logging truck. Grapple means to grip or grab. And this truck uses another type of grapple attachment to load a dump truck with paper and cardboard in a recycling plant.

So, you see that Front End Loaders can do all kinds of work using attachments. But, of all the possible attachments a loader can use, its favorite is definitely his bucket. Like the Excavator, a Front End Loader’s bucket is also known as a shovel.

Did you also know that some Front End Loaders have tracks instead of tires. Well, it’s true. Tracks give loaders more traction and more stability. But most loaders you see will probably have tires. That’s because tires allow a truck to drive faster and to move from place to place more easily. Either way, tracks or tires, these trucks are very good at moving loads around.

Oh no, there isn’t any on the road as good at loading heavy loads
As good at scooping up a load
As good at finding ways to load
There isn’t any on the road
As good at helping trucks to load
Front End Loader, you’re as good as gold
