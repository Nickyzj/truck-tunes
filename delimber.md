# DELIMBER

These are the ABC and Ds
Of the truck whose job it is
To clean all of the cut down trees
Of their limbs and of their branches

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Scraping All the Branches off
Cutting the trees with a muffled roar
Sucking logs into his mouth
Like a mechanical Dinosaur

Powered by a big Engine
He picks up all the trees the Feller
Buncher set down on the Ground
And prepares them to be Hauled
Hauled into the town

Oh, A is for All the wood he chews
And B is for the Branches he removes
Now C is for the Cuts that he delivers
And D, the letter D is for Delimber

To prevent an Injury
Its best to stay far back from him
Logs can Jump up or Kick back
When he is removing Limbs

To see how wide the trees are
And cut them just the right size
Some Delimbers Measure them
It’s a Noisy Operation
Working in the Pines

Oh, A is for All the wood he chews
And B is for the Branches he removes
Now C is for the Cuts that he delivers
And D, the letter D is for Delimber

(SPOKEN) A Delimber’s name also describes just what it does. A tree’s branches are also called “limbs”, so a Delimber’s job is to remove the limbs from trees. It does this by picking up the trees one by one and holding onto them while it scrapes off the branches. Then it uses a chain saw blade to cut the trees to the right length. Some Delimbers can also measure to see how wide a tree is. They do this to decide what kind of wood it will made into. Delimbers are very helpful trucks. They save a lot of time doing a job that used to be done by people with saws, who had to cut each branch of the tree themselves.

Oh, A is for All the wood he chews
And B is for the Branches he removes
Now C is for the Cuts that he delivers
And D, the letter D is for Delimber

Now where were we?
At letter Q?
Well let’s go then!

They can work oh so Quickly
Rarely taking vacations
Using chain Saws just like Teeth
In these forest locations

Delimbers are so very Useful
And so Valuable too
The logs they cut become our Wood
And oh so many kinds of paper
For you and me to use

Oh, A is for All the wood he chews
And B is for the Branches he removes
Now C is for the Cuts that he delivers
And D, the letter D is for Delimber

Delimbers are so eXcellent
Working almost all Year round
In any logging or timber Zone
If you do no more than look
They’re certain to be found

Oh, A is for All the wood he chews
And B is for the Branches he removes
Now C is for the Cuts that he delivers
Oh, and D, the letter D
Yes D the letter D
Oh D the letter D
Is for Delimber
