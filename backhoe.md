# BACKHOE

He’s like a loader, and a digger and grader, too
There aren’t many jobs that this truck can’t do

To switch from one to the other easy so
Push the picture on the button and to work you go

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!

If you’ve got a tough job that you need to do
Where an excavator ‘n’ loader wouldn’t have room

Just let him know, and he’ll be there
He can do so much some say it isn’t fair

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!

His two stabilizers keep him steady so
To scoop a load, he’s always ready to go

You can move him around using his controls
Spend all day just digging holes

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!

(SPOKEN) Now, do you remember what we called these legs just a minute ago? That’s right, they’re called stabilizers. They help to keep the backhoe steady while it works. Whenever a backhoe is digging, you will see it sitting up on its stabilizers.

Some people call these trucks Backhoe Loaders, because they have a digger, which is called a backhoe, on one side and a loader on the other side. So Backhoes can both dig and load. But they can do so much more than that. Some of these trucks can use different attachments to do even more jobs. Why, this Backhoe Loader uses a blade that is attached to its bucket to grade or level the ground. And check this out: See how this machine is using an attachment to work as an Impact Hammer? He sure needs his stabilizers for a job like this. They help hold him in one place while he hammers. What an amazing truck!

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!

Now, don’t forget, he can also load
Filling this dump truck, working on the road

If you see him at work, you might want to say:
“Mom and Dad, I saw a backhoe today!”

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!

Look, here, this truck is his little bro’
He’s a miniature version of this backhoe

He can do anything his brother can do
Cuz he’s smaller he can work in tighter places, too

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mini Versatility, yeah!

And for all his capabilities
They call him Mr. Versatility, yeah!
