# STREET SWEEPER

He sweeps the street
Cleans up debris
He helps us keep
Our roads and
Parking lots so clean
He sweeps the street
He sweeps the street
So nice and neat
His bristly brooms
Sweep while he moves
They spin and spin
And spin again
Cuz that’s the way he sweeps the street
Yes, that’s the way he sweeps the street
He sweeps the street
Cleans up debris
He helps us keep
Our roads and
Parking lots so clean
He sweeps the street
He sprays the road
Each little hose
Shoots water ‘round
And wets the ground
It keeps the dust
From flying up
And that’s the way he sprays the road
Yes, that’s the way he sprays the road
He sweeps the street
Cleans up debris
He helps us keep
Our roads and
Parking lots so clean
He sweeps the street
He dumps his bin
And lifts it then
It’s called a hopper
Yes, that’s his hopper
Pours out a hunk
Of dirt and junk
Oh, that’s the way he dumps his bin
Yes, that’s the way he dumps his bin

So every day
In his own way
He’s out there sweeping
Simply keeping
Roads so clean
For you and me
Cuz, that’s the way he does this thing
Yes, that’s the way he does this thing
He sweeps the street
Cleans up debris
He helps us keep
Our roads and
Parking lots so clean
He sweeps the street
He sweeps the street
Cleans up debris
He helps us keep
Our roads and
Parking lots so clean
He sweeps the street
