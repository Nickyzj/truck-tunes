# GARBAGE TRUCK

Garbage, refuse, trash, or waste
For all these things he has a taste
Bet there’s a Garbage Truck that works near you
At the job he loves to do

Look! If you watch
Then you’ll see him weekly
If he could talk
Well then he’d say, “Feed me”

All of the stuff
That you just don’t need he
Gobbles it up
Like a sweet, sweet treat
Gobbles it up
Like a sweet, sweet treat

Garbage, refuse, trash, or waste
For all these things he has a taste
Bet there’s a Garbage Truck that works near you
At the job he loves to do

He lifts containers
Or cans that’s easy
With grapple arms
Or forks like these he
Puts everything in
A hopper in back
Then smashes it up
To make it compact
Smashes it up
To make it compact

Garbage, refuse, trash, or waste
For all these things he has a taste
Bet there’s a Garbage Truck that works near you
At the job he loves to do

At the end of the day
When he’s all filled up he
Heads to the landfill
Some call it the dump
When he backs up, beeping
Pushing trash in a block
Then he’s back on the road
Making all his stops
He’s back on the road
Making all his stops
He’s back on the road
Making all his stops

Garbage, refuse, trash, or waste
For all these things he has a taste
Bet there’s a Garbage Truck that works near you
At the job he loves to do

Garbage, refuse, trash, or waste
For all these things he has a taste
Bet there’s a Garbage Truck that works near you
At the job he loves to do
