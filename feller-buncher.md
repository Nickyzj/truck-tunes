Do you know what Feller means?
Well I can tell you now
To fell is to make something fall
By cutting or knocking it down
See the blade cut this great big tree

And Buncher well you might have guessed
Exactly what that means
Just look here now, it’s grabbing
And bunching all these trees

This great big truck can really move
It’s as nimble as can be
It can spin itself completely around
That’s 360 degrees, wow!

The Feller Buncher’s big and strong
As you can plainly see
Let’s stop this blade and check it out
As it cuts this giant tree
Wow, it’s more than 6 feet wide

Yeah, Feller Buncher, Feller Bucher

(SPOKEN) Feller Buncher is kind of a funny name, but it describes exactly what this cool truck does. To “fell” means to knock or cut down. And to “bunch” means to gather things together. So a Feller Buncher cuts down trees and then bunches them together.

Like most big trucks, Feller Bunchers can be dangerous. Can you read the words that are on this Feller Buncher’s boom? They say, “Keep back 300 feet.” That’s a lot of room. 300 feet is the length of a football field. Look, it has the same words on the back of the truck. Because this truck could swing all the way around at any time, and because of its sharp, powerful blade and the heavy loads of trees that it can carry, no one should get too close while it’s working. Not even other big trucks.

Now, Feller Buncher, back to work
You’ve got lots more stuff to do
We’ll return to say “hello”
Again very, very soon
