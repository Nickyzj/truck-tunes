# EXCAVATOR

This is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does
I said this is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does

He’s an Excavator
His work is more like fun
He digs with his big bucket
And works out in the sun

He can dig the deepest
Holes that you have ever seen
Other trucks can dig, oh yes
But not like this machine
No, not like this machine

This is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does
I said this is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does

See how long his boom is
Reaching far below
The tracks that keep him safe from
Falling in this deep, deep hole

One of his best talents
Is spinning all the way around
In either of both directions
His tracks stay firmly on the ground

(SPOKEN) Excavators are sometimes called Diggers. This is because their main job is to dig. Do you see how far down this bucket can go? Other trucks, like front end loaders, can’t reach their buckets nearly this low. The bucket on both of these kinds of trucks can be called a shovel, just like the shovel you use to dig up dirt and sand. But an excavator’s shovel is huge and very strong. Look at the teeth on this shovel. Some excavators can dig up more than a ton in one scoop of their bucket.

This is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does
I said this is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does

After a long day of
Hard and dusty, dusty work
He likes to take a shower
And spray off all that dirt

He’ll start tomorrow early
Just as the new day dawns
And work a long, long day again
But you’ll never see him yawn

This is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does
I said this is the work I really love
Because that’s what an Excavator does
