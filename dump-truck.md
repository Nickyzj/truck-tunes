# DUMP TRUCK

Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Oh, dump it

Loading up some boulders
Working with a loader
Or maybe even a backhoe, oh, oh
Grab an excavator
He’ll do all the labor
And now we’re ready
To load, load, load

So, load, load, load him up
Load the Dump Truck
Load, load, load him up
Load the Dump Truck
Load, load, load him up
Load the Dump Truck
Oh, load him up

So, what does he carry?
Well anything that’s heavy
Like these giant rocks, you know?
Or lots of tiny pebbles
Thousands of tiny pebbles
And now we’re ready
To back him up

So, back, back, back him up
Back the Dump Truck
Back, back, back him up
Back up Dump Truck
Back, back, back him up
Back the Dump Truck
Oh, back him up

Where does he get the strength
To lift his giant bed
He must have a back of steel
He uses his hydraulic ram
To lift his bed, you see
With power extraordinary

So, dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Oh, dump it, Dump Truck
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Oh, dump it

You know, you know you got to dump
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
You know, you know you got to dump
Dump, dump, dump, dump it
Dump it, Dump Truck
Oh, dump it
