# BUCKET TRUCK

Lifting up up up in a b-b-bucket truck
Climbing high high high in the sky-y
When it’s tough tough tough and a ladder’s not enough
You need a b-b-b-b-bucket
A bucket on a truck

Need to trim your trees?
He makes it such a breeze
Fixing lights and wires
He climbs high high higher

Hanging cable too?
Well he is able to
Strong like a table too
And just as stable too

But so that you don’t fall
A harness is a good call

When on a bucket truck
Aerial bucket truck
Oh he’s a bucket truck
Climb in a bucket truck

Lifting up up up in a b-b-bucket truck
Climbing high high high in the sky-y
When it’s tough tough tough and a ladder’s not enough
You need a b-b-b-b-bucket
A bucket on a truck

He’s got some other names
Some call them Bucket Cranes
Or why not Cherry Picker?
Lifting workers quicker

Need to be elevated?
Your lift accelerated?
He’s got it regulated
Don’t underestimate it

His hydraulics go
Controlled above and below

Cause he’s a bucket truck
Aerial bucket truck
Yeah he’s a bucket truck
Or some say basket truck

And it’s important to be smart
Thinking safety from the start
Oh, especially when working with wires
(Beware the w-w-wires!)
So you put on rubber gloves
While you work high up above
Yeah, cause that’s what electricity requires!

Be careful up there!

When it’s tough tough tough and a ladder’s not enough
