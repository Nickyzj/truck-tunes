# VACUUM TRUCK

Just like the machine
That you use in your home
His job is to clean
He’s much bigger, though

Yeah, he can suck up this junk
With his high-suction hose
It looks like a trunk
Yeah, like an elephant nose
Just like an elephant nose

Swing, swing your hose
Like an elephant trunk
Clean up the road
Suck up all of the junk
Swing back and forth
And with any luck
You’ll clean up
Like a Vacuum Truck

He drives down the road
Finding trash to clean up
He moves oh so slowly
He’s not in a rush
He works by controls
That look almost the same
As the kind you use
Playing a video game
Just like a video game

So, swing, swing your hose
Like an elephant trunk
Clean up the road
Suck up all of the junk
Swing back and forth
And with any luck
You’ll clean up
Like a Vacuum Truck

Let’s hear you do it
Make the sound that he makes
A whoosh or a shoosh
It’s all that it takes
And we’ll watch as he works
He’ll leave us all awed
He’s got enough power
To suck up a dirt clod
Yeah, a big dirt clod
Wow, that’s a huge dirt clod!
Well, that’s just impressive

So, swing, swing your hose
Like an elephant trunk
Clean up the road
Suck up all of the junk
Swing back and forth
And with any luck
You’ll clean up
Like a Vacuum Truck

Let’s see you swing it
Like an elephant trunk
Let’s see you clean up
Suck up all of the junk
Swing it back and forth
And with any luck
You’ll clean up
Like a Vacuum Truck
You’ll clean up
Like a Vacuum Truck
