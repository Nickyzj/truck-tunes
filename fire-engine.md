# FIRE ENGINE

Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out
Call me on the radio
He will put it out
Need help with an emergency
He will help you out
Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out

He gets the call
Loads up his crew
And sounds his horn
He’s needed now
And this big truck
Has not a moment to lose
Flashes his lights
His sirens howl
Get out of his way
He’s got to move
He’s got to get there now

Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out
Call me on the radio
He will put it out
Need help with an emergency
He will help you out
Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out

Now at the fire
Unrolls his hose
And turns it on
The hydrant pumps
Some trucks add foam
To make the fire go out
The building is tall
The flames stretch high
Get out of the way
The ladder climbs
Till it reaches the sky

To fight the blaze
He carries lots of gear
So the fire fighters
Can have no fear
He’s well equipped
With pikes and poles
And axes so sharp
He’s not afraid
This truck is in control
Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out

Call me on the radio
He will put it out
Need help with an emergency
He will help you out
Can you tell me where the fire is?
He will put it out
