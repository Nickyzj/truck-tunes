# IMPACT HAMMER

Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer

When you need to smash up
Concrete, rocks or asphalt
This is the machine
You’ll want to call

See how easy it is
To break the street to pieces
With a truck as strong as
This one isIt’s the kind of job
For the truck they call
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer

The force of the hydraulics
Sends hundreds of pounds
Of power slamming
Right into the ground

Keep a safe distance
When it is working
‘Cause chunks of rocks ‘n’ things
Go flying

Careful when you see
The machine they call
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer

The hammer operator
Safe inside the driver’s cab
Wears safety goggles
And a hard hat

There are two big joysticks
That control the hammer
They tell it where to go
And when to hit

It’s the kind of job
For the truck they call
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer

(SPOKEN) Watch how the impact hammer sets his blade down on the ground behind him. This helps him to keep steady while he pounds away at the street. His tracks also keep him stable.

These machines are used to break up hard materials, like the asphalt on this street. The impact hammer uses a chisel-like steel bit that jabs very quickly up and down to smash up whatever it needs to break. Impact hammers are also sometimes called hydraulic hammers.

Rat-a-tat tat-tat-tat
Rat-a-tat tat-tat-tat

They make a lot of noise
As they pound into the ground
So earplugs are a very, very
Good choice

Careful when you see
The machine they call
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer

It’s the kind of job
For the truck they call
Impact Hammer, Impact Hammer
