Let’s say you got to get to school
Wouldn’t riding with your friends be cool?
A School Bus picks you up first thing
Gets you to class before the school bell rings

When the bus picks you up or drops you off
She goes and puts out a sign so traffic stops
Her flashing lights alert drivers to “Watch out!”
Because the kids’ safety is paramount
I say the kids’ safety is paramount

A city bus can take you anywhere
You step right in and you pay your fare
And you could take your bike along
Right in front of the bus is where it belongs

These buses are so strong, they’re so very strong
See how this bus is two cars – one, two – two cars long?
Some are powered by fuels like gas, and see
How this bus get its strength from electricity
It gets its strength from electricity

Well a passenger bus makes longer trips
Down highways and freeways you can see them zip
Takes you far away to other towns
The perfect truck to get you around

And lookee here, lookee here, this one’s designed
With all the sight-seeing tourists well in mind
Some have two levels where you can sit
They call these double-deckers
They call them double-deckers
Yeah, they’re called double-deckers and they’re legit
