# GRADER

Have you ever seen a truck like this?
Working the job they’re kinda hard to miss
If you know his name, well you can shout it now
And if you said “Grader,” well all I can say is “Wow!”

Some people call them Graders, some people call them Blades
They’re very good at getting the road readied up to pave
And when it’s very cold outside and there is lots of snow
You may see one cruising by, using its blade to clear the road

The main part of the grader is this straight blade you see here
One side in front of the other as the driver sits and steers
The front is called the toe and the back is called the heel
The blade’s job is to level out the dirt behind the forward wheels

(SPOKEN) So, this kind of truck is called a Grader. Remember how we said that Scrapers do “rough grading”? Well, a Grader’s job is to do “finish grading”. Scrapers and Bulldozers help to flatten out the ground to prepare it for roads and buildings to sit on it. But these trucks leave the ground still pretty rough. So, when they’re all done, the Grader comes in and finely sets the surface of the ground. They can do this because of the wide, flat blade that they can control very carefully. The Blade is the most important part of the truck. For this reason, many people call Graders “Blades”.

The Grader can do lots of cool tricks. For instance, he can climb over rocks or humps of dirt or anything else that might get in the way, one wheel at a time. This way the blade can still stay level, even though the one wheel may go up over something. And check this out. See how the Grader can lean his wheels? This is another trick that the truck can use to have more control over his blade. Most other trucks can only hold their wheels straight up and down. So, the next time you see trucks out at work, look and see if any of them can lean their wheels like a Grader can. I betcha they can’t.

Have you ever seen a truck like this?

And if you said “Grader,” well all I can say is “Wow!”

Here’s a special feature many trucks don’t have
If you watch real close, I’m sure you’ll understand
The front wheel goes up and over this great mound
While the blade stays where it is, nice and level with the ground

Another of this truck’s really unique abilities
Is to do a special trick, it’s called a wheel lean
By leaning his wheels just a bit or even quite a lot
The grader operator here can control how his blade cuts

So, have you ever seen a truck like this?
Working the job they’re kinda hard to miss
If you know his name, you can whisper it now
If you said “Grader,” well all I can say is “Good Job!”
